### Project Name: Spam email detection
### Project description:
__In this project, we will build a spam email classifier that can tell whether a given email is a spam email or not based on the email’s content. In the email classification, after preprocessing the email contents, I will use three machine learning algorithms to train our dataset which are bags-of-words, logistic regression. By changing the parameters in these algorithm, I can find the best model for these algorithms. After we get the training results from the training set, evaluate matrics to discuss our results and judge our models.__
### Project plan:
- Clean up the data set. Our dataset is from 
- Preprocessing emails. (e.g. stem the words and change '$' sign to 'dollar')
- Build a word vocabulary, including counting the word frequency in the dataset 
- Feature extraction. Choose appropriate features for classification 
- Train the data (Use Naive Bayes, logistic regression and bag-of-words or other model)
- Test our parameters for test set, and get results. 
- Calculate some evaluation matric to judge our model, such as precision, recall, F1-score and so on.
- Conclude and discuss the results # spam_classifer_project
